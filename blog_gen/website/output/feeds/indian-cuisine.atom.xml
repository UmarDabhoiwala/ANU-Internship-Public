In Mumbai, kadak chai is a popular choice - this strong and bold tea is made by boiling milk, sugar, and tea leaves together. The result is a robust tea that is perfect for dipping biscuits or samosas.
In contrast, Kashmiri chai is a fragrant and delicately spiced tea that is brewed with green tea leaves, saffron, and cardamom. The addition of almonds and subtle sweetness sets this chai apart from others. The tea is also renowned for its pink color, which comes from the use of special tea leaves.
Moving south, the Chennai-style filter coffee is often referred to as chai due to its popularity. In Delhi, the chai is often spiced with peppercorns and cinnamon sticks, while in Kolkata it is often enjoyed with a side of savory snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring the diverse regional varieties of Indian chai is a great way to experience the country's rich tea culture. Each region has its unique take on this beloved beverage, making it an exciting world to discover.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Indian cuisine"></category><category term="Indian tea"></category><category term="regional chai"></category><category term="kadak chai"></category></entry><entry><title>The Art of Perfecting Indian Chai</title><link href="n/art-of-indian-chai.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2021-06-14T08:00:00+10:00</published><updated>2021-06-14T08:30:00+10:00</updated><author><name>Umar Dabhoiwala</name></author><id>tag:None,2021-06-14:n/art-of-indian-chai.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Learn how to brew the perfect cup of Indian chai with these tips and tricks.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Indian chai, also known as masala chai, is a popular tea beverage that has gained international fame. While there are many ways to brew chai, there are certain techniques that can help you perfect your cup of tea. First, choose high-quality tea leaves and fresh spices, such as cardamom, cinnamon, and ginger. Second, heat your milk and spices in a saucepan before adding the tea leaves. Let the tea simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.
In terms of brewing time, it's important not to over-steep the tea, which can lead to a bitter taste. Most chai recipes recommend steeping for 3-5 minutes. Lastly, strain the tea to remove any residue and enjoy hot with a sweetener like honey or sugar.
Whether you prefer your chai traditional or with a twist, by following these tips and experimenting with different blends, you too can become a chai connoisseur.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Indian cuisine"></category><category term="Indian tea"></category><category term="masala chai"></category><category term="tea brewing"></category></entry></feed>
